(ttlr/schedule :costly-thing update-costly-thing (* 60 1000) (update-costly-thing))

# ttlr

TTL with refresh. You `schedule` refreshes to take place and store things under a particular `:key-name`.

## Why not memoize or core.cache?

Because we wanted a way to be able to retrieve things in the background rather than have a user take the penalty of retrieving the item when the cache expires.
